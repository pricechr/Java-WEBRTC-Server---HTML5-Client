Java-WEBRTC-Server---HTML5-Client
=================================

This is a Java based single class WebRTC Signaling server with an HTML5 Client. Just put this class file in any project and run it. That is all. For the HTML5 client you just have to plug in the servers IP before deployment. This project implements its own Plain java, Plain socket stack for the websockets protocol. No JEE or NodeJS solutions that don't actually teach you what is going on!. Please give me a job.. I am eating beans https://www.facebook.com/christopher.price.921025
